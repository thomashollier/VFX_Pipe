## Background:
I've worked in high end VFX and animation production facilities for many years and I am part of the "first wave" of people who ended up inventing the workflow that has now been codified into the standard VFX production pipeline. (By the way, I don't want to take undue credit: there are so many other way smarter people who made significant impacts but I like to think some of my contributions have left a trace here or there...). Economic and personal circumstances have made it such that I am now working independently on the periphery of larger facilities, and I have found that the resources necessary to produce high end work that once were the exclusivity of large facilities are now available to smaller and perhaps more flexible and efficient organizations. 

## Must have tools.
In addition to artistry, an effective VFX production needs to efficiently process data in a non destructive way that targets specific tasks with a meaningful level of accuracy. The following tools provide that capability.

### ocio and ACES config files
This allows you to properly ingest imagery and deliver it in a way that maintains the integrity of the original data. Typically, footage will be ingested in some custom camera LOG format, be worked on in linear ACEScg, and deliver either in ACES or some display referred space. Most software tools are now aces compliant, and you need a properly set up environment to take advantage of it.

### oiio tools
Production always seems to create situations where something needs to be translated or converted in some custom fashion that is not easily achievable within the main software packages. oiiotool is a swiss army knife that can handle all common VFX image formats, color space conversions, generate textures, as well as some basic color correction and image processing. It has a python API and can easily be embedded in scripted tasks.

### ffmpeg
Ffmpeg is a workhorse that provides efficient solutions to needs relating to the ingest or the generation of video clips. Although it is very different in legacy and background from oiio, it makes a great partner to it and there is very little that can't be done with the two together. It also has various APIs that aloows it to be embedded in scripted processes.

### python
Because you need glue to stick things together

### bash
and sometimes, when you don't have time for the glue to dry, you can use duct tape to get you through your immediate need.

### openCV/pillow/imagemagick/vips
It's always good to have ways to manipulate images on the command line. The above commands and/or libraries do that. They each have their pluses and minuses. More or less fast, complicated to use, etc... No clear winner here but I use these to fill in the gap where oiiotool is missing specific functionality.

### Installing these tools
Installing software on linux can be quite an undertaking if you're not (or, actually, also if you are...) a developer. Fortunately, I found that the "brew" package manager has all the important packages, and they all seem quite up to date. So, install brew and just do this:

brew install ffmpeg opencolorio openimageio imagemagick opencv

If everything goes according to plan, it should fail in various unpredictable ways that will take you a while to figure out. To be fair, though, I've found that brew is actually generally reliable in terms of providing up to date versions while handling dependencies without too much headache. It's also available on osX.

Another necessary evil in this software soup is the python package manager "pip". The process of installing the right package in the right place with the right version of python can be very time consuming.

pip3 install pillow pyseq


## Open source software packages
### Blender
I'm not a power user but probably should be. A lot of great dev work is going into this. It's grown significantly more powerful over the last few years and it will continue to grab an increasing part of the production base, particularly as USD becomes more universally adopted.

### Darktable or Digikam
Lightroom is a great tool but I find that its cost is too steep for the specific functionality I am looking for. These two tools offer a good solution for handling photo reference and digital negatives for data aquisition.

### Meshroom
This is a great free photogrammetry tool. I've been able to capture large sets and accurately place cameras in that set.

### Gimp and Krita
Same as Darktable or Digikam: If you don't feel you are getting the value out of the Adobe Creative Suite, these tools can offer most of photoshop's functionality.

### cube and HALD luts from ACES OCIO transforms
Use imagemagick to create a HALD image (this makes a 512x512 which seems accurate enough for my purpose but if you want a 24 bit, use 17 instead of 8):
~~~
magick hald:8 hald512_Neutral.png
~~~
Use oiiotool to bake any color correction in a new HALD image. In this case, I am creating a convert from ARRI Log space to aces, increasing the exposure by 2 stops, and then converting to sRGB.
~~~
oiiotool hald512_Neutral.png --colorconvert "Input - ARRI - V3 LogC (EI800) - Wide Gamut" "ACES - ACEScg" \
  -mulc 4 \
  --colorconvert "ACES - ACEScg" "output - sRGB" -o hald512_log2sRGB+2.png
~~~
Finally, I use [this handy little python script](https://github.com/thomashollier/LUT-Convert) to generate a cube lut
~~~
./hald_to_cube.py hald512_log2sRGB+2.png hald512_log2sRGB+2.cube
~~~
You can then apply any ACES color transforms in ffmpeg (extremely useful to quickly create accurate proxies)
~~~
ffmpeg -i darkCameraClipInLog.mxf -vf "lut3d=hald512_log2sRGB+2.cube,scale=1920:-1" twoStopsBrighterInsRGBClip.mov
~~~
### Watermarks with ffmpeg
You can add watermarks to your lut converted proxies

### Global texture correction with HALD luts
A texture paint package should allow you to apply global color corrections to a whole set of textures in one step but sometimes, you need to apply arbitrary correction to a set of texture images you inherited. You can color correct one texture in gimp or photoshop until you get the desired result, apply that correction to your neutral HALD image, save it out and apply it to all your textures.
